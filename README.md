# Project 7: A Food Ordering App

A food ordering application where users can browse items, add products to their cart, modify their order, and complete checkout. Built with React and React Router for the front-end interface and navigation, this project uses Firebase for database management and Axios for handling API requests. In building the app, I gained experience with full-stack practices, including state management, database connectivity, and user input handling.
